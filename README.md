## Developed Website

### About my Development Phase

* Developing an website with Javascript was quite challenging, i must say initial development phase was quite demotivating and a struggling period, I had very little hope on completing this project but now when I see my finished project, I feel really proud and confident for bringing the requirement to live. Every single line of the code was a learning phase. I feel more confident as a developer now.

* As mentioned previously in the user stories i have implemented the requirement as user and as a administrator. This is a single page website very easy to navigate between the sections.

### Color Scheme of website
